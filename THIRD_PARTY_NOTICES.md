Parts of ACEStepMusic's network code (the attention, encoder, quantizer, detokenizer and DiT layer structure, the configuration fields and the constrained-decoding state names) were adapted from mere.run's Swift ACE-Step implementation (github.com/sawfwair/mere-run, MereRunCore/ACEStep), under this licence:

## ACE-Step 1.5

The port follows github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5 at ca1e85f (MIT); the weights are ACE-Step/Ace-Step1.5 on Hugging Face (MIT), fetched from the byte-identical copy at arraypress/song-ace-step-1.5:

## YuE2 inference code (m-a-p, Apache-2.0)

YuE2Music is a Swift/MLX implementation that follows m-a-p's YuE2 inference code, yue2-infer
(https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE, 0.1.5 as shipped in m-a-p/YuE2-3B at
8f24312; 0.1.6 at commit 1647252d68b70cbead046ffd3f7caf036dde47ee declares its licence):
its prompt protocol (token ids and instruction lines), its sampling rules and its NAR
midpoint flow-matching solver. Copyright the YuE authors, Multimodal Art Projection (m-a-p).
Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0; you may obtain a copy at
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 (the full text is in that repository's
LICENSE). No Python source is included here; the Swift is new and is distributed under this
package's MIT licence, with this notice for the work it follows.

## YuE2 weights (m-a-p, CC BY-NC 4.0 with an individual-creator permission)

YuE2Music runs the YuE2-3B, YuE2-Vae and YuE2-Vae-legacy weights
(https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/YuE2-3B). They are not part of this package: they are fetched
by a person who has accepted their terms. They are licensed under Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode)
together with the licensors' additional permission of 2026-09-16 (MODEL_LICENSE at the
commit above): individuals may use the weights free of charge and monetise their outputs;
companies need a commercial licence from the licensors; responsible-use conditions apply;
the weights themselves may not be sold or redistributed commercially. `YuE2Licence` carries
the permission verbatim and `song models licence yue2` prints it.

The YuE2 decoder is the Oobleck VAE with SnakeBeta activations. In this package that network
(MusicNetworks) is shared with ACE-Step, and upstream's notice for it reads: "The Oobleck VAE
and SnakeBeta implementation in modeling_vae.py is derived from stable-audio-tools commit
a6ae0cdf8b2eb1567a4b42ceadddec3712d99d45."
